## Project Overview
The following is a personal finance data analysis project where I analyzed my spending patterns, income sources and financial health. I used data visualization and descriptive statistics to gain insights into the data. The goal is to identify areas where I can save money and make better financial decisions.
## Objectives
- To work on a real-world data and save money.
- Embed Analytics into daily life.
- Financial Literacy at early age.

## Questions that drive my Analysis:
- What is my spending pattern?
- Which months are financially good or bad?
- Where does most amount of my money go?
- What is my net worth?

## Preparation and Cleaning:
- Integrated data from multiple sources, such as bank statements, credit card bills, and investment accounts, to provide a holistic view of the my currrent financial health.
- The data for this project can also be collected from a personal finance tracking app or spreadsheet. The data will include date, description, category, amount and income/expense/savings variables.
- You can see the raw data in this [LINK](https://github.com/subhojitdas859/MyFi_Analysis_Project/blob/main/files/MyFi%20Spreadsheet.xlsx) As you can see in the image below, the format of the data was not appropriate for the analysis, so it had to be cleaned and prepared.
